## 📦 Features

### 🧑‍💼 User Interface & Navigation
- 🔹 **Splash Screen**: Rounded-corner animated splash screen with branding and dots loading animation.
- 🔹 **Auth System**: Login & Signup interface with input validation and connected database.
- 🔹 **Main Menu**: Offers two main options – `Book Ticket` or `Book Ride`.
- 🔹 **Responsive Booking Forms**:
    - ✈️ Ticket Booking: `From`, `To`, `Date`, `Time`, `Passengers`, `Transport Type (Bus/Train)`
    - 🚗 Ride Booking: User can choose `Car` or `Bike`, with time and location inputs.

### 📄 Booking Confirmation
- ✅ Custom confirmation window styled like a physical ticket/receipt.
- 🖼️ Uses visuals (`ticket2.png`, `ride.png`) to enhance the ticket view.

### 🎨 UI Design & Aesthetics
- 🎨 Modern and clean UI using Java Swing components.
- ⭕ Rounded windows and panels for a polished look.
- 🖱️ Hover effects, draggable windows, and consistent color palette.

### 💾 Connected Database (Not Just File Handling!)
- 🗃️ **All user credentials are securely stored in the connected Microsoft Access database file `users.accdb`,** accessed via the **UCanAccess JDBC library**.
- 🧩 This structure separates GUI and data logic while introducing students to real database interaction without external servers.
- 📂 On successful login, the app reads user details (name, email) from the database and displays them in the main interface.
